# Amazon_Review_Analysis


### Overview

   Our purpose of this project is analyzing Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. We need to see if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in the dataset.
