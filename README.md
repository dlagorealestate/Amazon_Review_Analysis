### Overview

   Our purpose of this project is analyzing Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program.

We need to see if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in the dataset.

### Summary

  In our analysis  we can see 51% of the reviews in the Vine program were 5 stars reviews. The percentage of non-Vine reviews was 39%. This means there is definitely a positive bias for reviews in the Vine program. It would also be beneficial to also to use mean, median and mode to see the star rating for the Vine and non Vine reviews.
